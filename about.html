			<h2>Did You Know? </h2>
			<p>Did you know in order to retire comfortably, you need at least 70% of your working income! People are living longer and longer…the expected life expectancy of people born in year 2000 could exceed 90 years old! Do you have the financial tools and a plan to achieve a comfortable retirement?</p>
	
			<h2>You insure your house, you insure your car, why wouldn’t you insure your biggest asset?</h2>
			<p>Many people work hard to build assets and provide for their family, yet they don’t insure the most important asset- themselves! The average Canadian is under-insured, meaning they don’t have enough insurance to cover their needs. Insurance is not only very important as love and protection for your family, but it is a great investment tool for the future as well. Provide peace of mind for your family, and start investing in your future!</p>
